### [Update some existing data](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/update.html)
```sql
update
    cd.facilities
set
    initialoutlay = 10000
where
    facid = 1;
```

### [Update multiple rows and columns at the same time](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/updatemultiple.html)
```sql
update
    cd.facilities
set
    membercost = 6,
    guestcost = 30

### [Update a row based on the contents of another row](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/updatecalculated.html)
```sql
update
    cd.facilities facs
set
    membercost = (
        select
            membercost * 1.1
        from
            cd.facilities
        where
            facid = 0
    ),
    guestcost = (
        select
            guestcost * 1.1
        from
            cd.facilities
        where

    )
where
    facs.facid = 1;
```

### [Delete all bookings](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/delete.html)
```sql
delete from cd.bookings;
```

Unlike the `DELETE` statement, which removes rows one by one and can be rolled back, the `TRUNCATE` command is much faster because it removes all rows from the table at once and cannot be rolled back. It is often used when you want to quickly remove all data from a table without impacting its structure or schema. However, be cautious when using `TRUNCATE` as it does not trigger any `ON DELETE` triggers that might be associated with the table.
```sql
truncate cd.bookings;
```

### [Delete a member from the cd.members table](https://pgexercises.com/questions/updates/deletewh.html)

where
    memid not in (
        select
            memid
        from
            cd.bookings
    );
```
