```

### [List the total slots booked per facility per month, part 2](https://pgexercises.com/questions/aggregates/fachoursbymonth3.html)
```sql
select
    b.facid as "facid",
    extract(
        month
        from
            b.starttime
    ) as "month",
    sum(b.slots) as "slots"
from
    cd.bookings "b"
where
    starttime between '2012-01-01' and '2013-01-01'
group by
    rollup(facid, month)
order by
    b.facid,
    "month";
```

The `rollup` modifier allows you to produce multiple levels of grouping in the result set, which includes subtotals and a grand total. When you use `rollup`, the query will calculate subtotals for the specified columns from left to right, producing results for the combination of the columns in the order they appear in the `group by` clause.

In the example, the `rollup(facid, month)` clause specifies that you want to group the data by `facid` and `month` and also get subtotals for both columns. The `group by rollup(facid, month)` creates subtotals for each `facid`, each `month`, and a grand total that includes all the data.

### [List the total hours booked per named facility](https://pgexercises.com/questions/aggregates/fachours3.html)
```sql

    trim(to_char(sum(b.slots) / 2.0, '9999999999999999D99')) as "Total Hours"
from
    cd.facilities "f"
    inner join cd.bookings "b" on f.facid = b.facid
group by
    f.facid
order by
    f.facid asc;
```

### [List each member's first booking after September 1st 2012](https://pgexercises.com/questions/aggregates/nbooking.html)
```sql
select
    m.surname as "surname",
    m.firstname as "firstname",
    m.memid as "memid",
    min(b.starttime) as "starttime"
from
    cd.members "m"
    inner join cd.bookings "b" on m.memid = b.memid
where
    starttime >= '2012-09-01'
group by
    m.memid
order by
    "memid" asc;
```

### [Produce a list of member names, with each row containing the total member count](https://pgexercises.com/questions/aggregates/countmembers.html)
```sql
select
    count(*) over() as "count",
    m.firstname as "firstname",
    m.surname as "surname"
from
    cd.members "m"
group by
    m.firstname,
    m.surname,
    m.joindate
order by
    m.joindate;
```

In SQL, the `OVER()` clause is used in conjunction with certain aggregate functions to perform window functions. Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a "window" of rows related to the current row without grouping the rows into a single result.

You can put the followings as arguments:
1. PARTITION BY
2. ORDER BY
3. ROWS/RANGE
4. ROWS BETWEEN \_\_ and \_\_
5. CURRENT ROW
6. UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
7. UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

### [Produce a numbered list of members](https://pgexercises.com/questions/aggregates/nummembers.html)
```sql
select
    row_number() over(
        order by
            m.joindate
    ) as "row_number",
    m.firstname as "firstname",
    m.surname as "surname"
from
    cd.members "m"
order by
    m.joindate;
```

In this query, we don't define a partition, meaning that the partition is the entire dataset. Since we define an order for the window function, for any given row the window is: start of the dataset -> current row.

This exercise should mostly use familiar concepts, although we do introduce the NTILE window function. NTILE groups values into a passed-in number of groups, as evenly as possible. It outputs a number from 1->number of groups. We then use a CASE statement to turn that number into a label!
